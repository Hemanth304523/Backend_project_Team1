Only tools matching **all conditions** are returned.

### 3️⃣ Review & Rating System
- Users can submit reviews with a rating (1–5 stars) and optional comments
- Reviews are stored separately from tools
- Ratings are **automatically recalculated** based on approved reviews only
- This ensures fair and accurate tool rankings

---

### 4️⃣ Admin Moderation
Admins have full control over platform content:
- Add, edit, and delete AI tools
- Approve or reject user reviews
- Control which reviews affect tool ratings

Admin APIs are clearly separated from user APIs to maintain security and structure.

---

## 🔌 API-Driven Architecture

The project exposes RESTful APIs including:
- Fetch all AI tools
- Filter tools using query parameters
- Submit user reviews
- Admin endpoints for tool and review management

The system emphasizes **clean architecture**, **separation of concerns**, and **scalable design**.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Real-world backend API design
- Database modeling and relationships
- Derived data computation (average ratings)
- Role-based access (user vs admin)
- Production-style filtering logic

---

## 🚀 Use Case

The AI Tool Finder can serve as:
- A learning project for backend engineering
- A foundation for a full-stack AI discovery platform
- A demonstration of REST API best practices
